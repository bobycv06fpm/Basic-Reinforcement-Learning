# Basic-Reinforcement-Learning

Here are a few basic algorithm for the Reinforcement Learning Problems (mostly apt for MAB (Multi Armed Bandits))


The algorithm are in focus and therefore the distribution of rewards are taken to be something specific - a gaussian.

This code is written for 3 arms with normal distribution for their rewards but with different mean and variances.
The code can be extended for many number of arms and different distributions too

The algorithms dealt are -
1. UCB-1
2. Epsilon Greedy Algorithm (The basic variant)
3. Exploit Only
4. Explore Only
